# Things to always keep in mind

- Are we solving the right problem?
    - Ask what are the business drivers?
    - Why this problem is required to be addressed now?
    - What will be the impact if we don't solve it?
- Are we picking up the right solution for the problem or are we just going after shiney new objecs !!
